### Overview of Portfolio
***Description of Program Functionality***  
The python program takes an argument of the spreadsheet file's location
to then process the file's contents into an acceptable String format. Once that
is complete, the program will pickle and un-pickle the contents to verify the
pickling process.  

***Instructions to Run***  
In a **Windows** environment make sure to use \"\\\" for the file pathing.  
In a **Mac/Linux** environment you can use \"/\" for the file pathing.

Typically the command to run will be: **python [python_file_path]
[spreadsheet_file_path]**  

***Strength and Weaknesses of Python for Text Processing***  
*Strengths:*  
The data structures in python are very convenient. Accessing the
regular expression library was also very simple.  

*Weaknesses:*  
While the data structures are very convenient, I fear that the
simplification of data structures leaves a lot wanting when there are challenges
when the data structures is needed to handle more complex problems. There's also
a significant loss of readability.  

***Learning Experience***  
I believe I learned a lot from this assignment. The way python handles command
arguments differs a bit from other languages -- which is to be expected. I also
refamiliarized myself with the python data structures. Additionally, I was never
introduced to the concept of pickling until this assignment. Lastly, the use of
regular expressions was a good review for myself.
