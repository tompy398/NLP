Technical Skills:
- Communication
  * For system and model design, I have had to try to communicate what my idea was in a manner that could be understood clearly by both parties. When words simply fail to convey the technical complexity of something, I strove to draw out my designs. Additionally, I consistently brought out graphs and charts to ensure that there's no possible confusion. This not only helped to clear the air of any technical abstraction and unruly interpretation but also let my team member contribute ideas based off of the model. This allowed for the both of us to build, manipulate, and refine our technical communication skills and software development abilities.
  * Communicating is simply not just about fitting a bunch of jargon into a statement but rather making sure that a person understands the "idea" and getting it across successfully. In turn, due to the technicality of certain things, jargon is absolutely necessary yet we can "abstract" this by bringing into a medium that I believe we can all understand which is drawings and illustrations.
- Scheduling
  * Due to the complexity of human life, it was a difficult task to find an appropriate time for team members to collaborate in such an optimal manner where we were at our best. In reality, the situation turned into oscillating between optimal work flows.
- Analytical Thinking
  * Throughout the development of various system, my team member and I had to constantly analyze the implementation of various features to include. Analyzing benefit-cost of the inclusion of a feature was key. For example, in one of our projects we had initially wanted to implement a front-end design in to our software. However, the cost of learning and working that into our system design was thought to be extraneous and unnecessary. Additionally, we would do pseudo code reviews by going our code and fixing any bugs together. This proved effective as we were able to fix various problems.
- Ability to work both as a Team and Independently
  * At times throughout the projects, there was a general consensus that as a team we would understand the work that needed to be done and then split our separate ways to independently implement our features in the way that we thought is best to what we originally understood. Afterwards, as a team, every member would come back and seek guidance or adjustment of their code to fit into the overall implementation. This proved to be a successful methodology for working with relatively small teams.
- Summary
  * I learned a lot about the various ways that Natural Language Processing works algorithmically. First through probabilistic models and later on through machine learning implementations that leap towards neural networks and eventually deep learning. I extremely enjoyed learning about the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing and I wish to continue to see advancements and learn more about the fascinating ways that people continue to develop in the field.
  * The Natural Language Processing techniques that I have learned in class will definitely a part of some of my future personal projects such as word frequency, building a word bank, and using various models to learn something and get back appropriate results.
  * I would love to continue working in the field of Artificial Intelligence and learning more about it as the field continues to grow at an unprecedented rate.
